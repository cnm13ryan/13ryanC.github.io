How about the origins of the human species as adovcated from Yuval noah harari.

The first people to live in UK were hunter and gathers in Stone age (when to when?).

During stone age, the UK was connected to the European content by an ice land bridge.

The Uk only become permanently separate from the European continent by the Channel about 10,000 years ago.

When were the first farmers arrived to the UK, they arrived about 6,000 years ago.

Experts believed that the ancestors of these farmer come from south-east Europe.

How about the previous hunters and gathers, do you mean there are nobody settled in the UK prior the farmers coming to the UK?

How do these farmers acquire food, via farming ? if so, cattle farming or like China via farming crops ?

What did these farmers build and what are the evidence.

Expert claims that Stonehenge is one of them, which the Stonehenge is situated in Wilshire, next to Chestshire.

Experts thought that the stonehenge was probably a special gathering place for seasonal ceremonies.

Skara Brae is the best preserved prehistoric village in northern Europe from the Stone Age, which helped archaeologists to understand more about how people lived near the end of the Stone Age.

When the Bronze age started ? Is it 4000 years ago ? People started making bronze.

Experts claimed that these people lived in roundhouses and buried their dead in tombs called round barrows.

Some artefacts made in bronze and gold are found, this includes tools, ornaments and weapons.

Then it comes to the iron age (when to when), experts claim that people still lived in round-houses, but now ? grouped together into larger settlements, and in particular, some sites called hill forts, which looks like for defense purposes.

People learned how to make weapons and tools out of iron.

A very impressive hill fort can still be seen today at Maiden Castle, where is it ? Is it in Dorset?

What are the other hill forts that can be seen ?

Experts claim that most people then were farmers, craft workers, or warriors.

The language they spoke was in Celtic language family. What is the language?

It mentions that there are other similar langauges were spoken across Europe in the Iron age. What are they?

Why they say the related langauges are still spoken today in some parts of Wales, is it Welsh or something else ?

Also in some parts of Scotland and Ireland, again, is it scotish or irish ?
Or is it like Chinese where pre-historic chinese prounication is unkonwn but only via guesswork of its influence to Korean and Japanesec, can we say Cantonese is probably the language, as it share the most similarities.

It said that the people from the Iron age had sophisticated culture and economy, tell me more.

Also, I am told that they are first to min coins in the UK, with some inscribed with the names of Iron Age Kings. If so, tell me more about the different dynasties.

When is then British or the UK history marked as the beginnings ?


I am told that Julius Caesar led a Roman invasion of Britain in 55 BC. But how about before 55 BC. There surely be a lot happening but I am not told what happened. Tell me more.

How old is Julius Caesar when he invaded Britian ? 

I am told that Caesar's invasion of the UK is not successful, tell me more.

Why there is a near 100 year gap between Britian and its separation of the Roman Empire.

I am told that in AD 43, the Emperor Claudius led the Roman army in a new invasion, why and how?

There is little mention of who is fighting against the Roman Empire at the time in the UK.

There is mention of Boudicca, the queen of the Iceni in what is not eastern England, tell me more, as there should be more records of the history of the UK during this time and before that.

Note that Boudicca is remembered today, tell me why. 

In particular, there is a statue of Boudicca on Westminster Bridge in London, near the Houses of Parliament. Why ? Why ?

How come Scotland is never conquered by the Romans and how is Scotland like, how it is being ruled, how do people trade and livelihoods were like ?

Emperor Hadrian, who is this person. I am told that during his reign, a wall is built in the north of Englandto keep out the Picts (again what are the Picts), I am told that the Picts are the ancestors fo the Scottish people, but again, when are the Picts, are they from the Iron age, stone age? 

The lineage of history are in-consistent to be useful for any useful memorisation.

I am told that there were a number of forts inside the walls ? 

I am told that parts of the Hadrian's wall, including the forts of Housesteads and Vindolanda can still be seen, tell me more.

I am told that it is a popular area for walkers and is a UNESCO world heritage site. This goes with stonehenge as well.

I am told that the Romans remained in the UK for 400 years. I know there is the Roman Baths in bath.

Tell me more about the relationship between the Roman Empire in the UK with Scotland and thus how people live in the UK.

I am told that the Romans built roads and public buildings, and have created a structure of law and introduced new plants and animals, but how all these affected the UK, and what did they bring in value for the UK ? Tell me more.

I am told that during the 3rd and 4th centuries AD that the first Christian communities began to appear in the UK. So when relgion is possible ? Where is catholic, as that was the norm. How christian is introduced ? Where is Martin Luther.

How is trade going on ?

Also, what's the language spoken at the time ?


I am told that the roman army left the UK in AD 410 to defend other parts of the Roman Empire.
Did they all retreat from the UK or just left a small army in the UK to defend itself. 

What was the demography like, are people satisfactory of their life under the Romans, are there any rebells ? 

I am told that after that, the UK was invaded by tribes from northern Europe, the Jutes, the Angles, and the Saxons, where do they come from, and why ?

I am told that the languages that they spoke form the basis of modern-day English. Tell me more.

I am told there were battles being fought against these invades (the jutes, the angles, and the saxons), but again who against who is unclear.

But by about AD 600, Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were established in the UK. How about the Jutes ?

What happened in between ?

I am told that these kingdoms were mainly in what is now England, in particular, I am told that the burial place of one of these kings was at Sutton Hoo in modern Suffolk.

What did they introduce to the UK?

I am told that this king buried in Sutton Hoo, was surrounded with treasure and armour, with all placed in a ship and was covered by a mound of Earth. How does it look like ?

I am told that by then, parts of the west of the UK, including much of Wales, Scotland, remained outside of Anglo-Saxon rule, if so, who are the ones that rule these places. Tell me more.


I am told that the Anglo-Saxons were not Christians initially, what did they preach ?

I am told that the Anglo-Saxons were eventually influenced by missionaries on Christianity. 

How about Catholithic ?

I am told that these missionaries come from Ireland, and spread the religion in the North.

St Patrick, patron saint of Ireland.
St Columba, who founded a monastery on the island of Iona, off the coast of Scotland.
St Augustine led missionsaries from Rome, spread Christianity in the south and became the first Archbishop of Canterbury.

Wait, isn't it in the middle ages, and not in the Anglo-Saxon era.

Also, why the Uk is eventually named after Anglo, but not Saxon, what happened.

England is named after one of the "Saxon tribes" that invaded the Angles, the Saxons and the Jutes, so England is in origin Angleland, many place names in England have Saxon origins

I am told that then the Vikings came from Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. They first visited Britain in AD 789 to raid coastal towns and take away good and slaves.

Then, they began to stay and form their own communities in the east of England and Scotland.

The Vikings came from Denmark, Norway and Sweden. They first visited Britain in AD 789 to raid coastal towns and take away goods and slaves. Then, they began to stay and form their own communities in the east of England and Scotland. The Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in England united under King Alfred the Great, who defeated the Vikings. Many of the Viking invaders stayed in Britain – especially in the east and north of England, in an area known as the Danelaw (many place names there, such as Grimsby and Scunthorpe, come from the Viking languages). The Viking settlers mixed with local communities and some converted to Christianity.

Anglo-Saxon kings continued to rule what is now England, except for a short period when there were Danish kings. The first of these was Cnut, also called Canute.

In the north, the threat of attack by Vikings had encouraged the people to unite under one king, Kenneth MacAlpin. The term Scotland began to be used to describe that country.

The Norman Conquest
In 1066, an invasion led by William, the Duke of Normandy (in what is now northern France), defeated Harold, the Saxon king of England, at the Battle of Hastings. Harold was killed in the battle. William became king of England and is known as William the Conqueror. The battle is commemorated in a great piece of embroidery, known as the Bayeux Tapestry, which can still be seen in France today.

The Norman Conquest was the last successful foreign invasion of England and led to many changes in government and social structures in England. Norman French, the language of the new ruling class, influenced the development of the English language as we know it today. Initially the Normans also conquered Wales, but the Welsh gradually won territory back. The Scots and the Normans fought on the border between England and Scotland; the Normans took over some land on the border but did not invade Scotland.

William sent people all over England to draw up lists of all the towns and villages. The people who lived there, who owned the land and what animals they owned were also listed. This was called the Domesday Book. It still exists today and gives a picture of society in England just after the Norman Conquest.
